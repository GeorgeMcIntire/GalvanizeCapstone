System Requirements:

# Data Cleanup

I have included a CSV of the Pitchfork data that does not include any of the columns created doing NLP analysis.

Running data_cleanup.py will create a CSV with all data in the directory above wherever you clone this repo. You will need to install TextBlob and spaCy for that to run. Note that it takes ~30 minutes to run.
